Your opening text goes here.

## In-article heading --- it's an H2 because your title is the H1

And after another paragraph or two or three, you may want to add a subheading, which would be an H3, so it would be like the following.

### Subheading (H3)

Text here.

Maybe you want a code block to illustrate something. Here's one:

{% raw %}
```js

/* =========
This is some simple JavaScript, 
just so you can see how Eleventy handles 
a code block (with the help of PrismJS).
It doesn't **do** anything here, of course.
Helpful on a dev blog, eh?
========= */

var i, j
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  j = i
  console.log(j)
}

/* ========= 
When run, the above would output:

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
========= */

```
{% endraw %}

Closing text. That ends Post 7!
