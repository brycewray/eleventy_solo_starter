Your opening text goes here.

## In-article heading --- it's an H2 because your title is the H1

And after another paragraph or two or three, you may want to add a subheading, which would be an H3, so it would be like the following.

### Subheading (H3)

Text here.

And here's an example of how to use the `lazypicture` shortcode in `/src/utils/lazy-picture.js`:

{% lazypicture "screen-cap-from-Pippin-Williamson-s-page-builders-review_986x482.jpg", "Screen capture showing shortcodes from a WordPress page builder" %}

Closing text. That ends Post 3!
