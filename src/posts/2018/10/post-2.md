Your opening text goes here.

## In-article heading --- it's an H2 because your title is the H1

And after another paragraph or two or three, you may want to add a subheading, which would be an H3, so it would be like the following.[^fnExample]

[^fnExample]: Also, if you want to do footnotes in Markdown, this is how it's done. There's code in the `.eleventy.js` file to handle it properly (including **not** encasing the body copy's footnote reference numbers in brackets, thus overriding what unfortunately is the typical behavior with the usual plugin for the `markdown-it` parser.)

### Subheading (H3)

Text here.

And here's an example of how to use the `image` shortcode (which uses the `eleventy-img` plugin):

{% image "Early-Web-font-grfx-1-2018-10-16_1218x1296.jpg", "Image from Apple website in 1999 showing graphic elements as text" %}

Closing text. That ends Post 2!
